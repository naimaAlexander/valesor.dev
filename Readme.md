# Valesor Development Application

The core application for Valesor Development is one that combines an automated mentor with a system for ingesting and 
processing external news feeds. This application is built with a test first and an observability first mindset.

## Infrastructure

The core infrastructure is deployed into Kubernetes. It provides the underlying storage and indexing components needed by the applications.
